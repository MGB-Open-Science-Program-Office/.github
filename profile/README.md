**The Mass General Brigham Open Science Program Office** is the organizational hub that coordinates, facilitates, and supports open science activity at Mass General Brigham.  As many of MGB’s research and clinical teams are utilizing open collaborative approaches, the MGB OSPO, by way of MGB – Innovation, provides support and infrastructure to enable transparent, compliant technology development. Through the MGB open science license library, open science best practice guides, and other educational programming, we aim to advance patient-centered research and innovation by supporting digital innovators with system resources that enable academic, clinical, and commercial outcomes.

Beyond community building, we are hyper-focused on addressing the unique pitfalls and compliance risks surrounding open science innovation in clinical-research and digital health at Mass General Brigham and other academic medical settings.

# The MGB Open Science License Library

Although historically MGB – Innovation has encouraged the use of an OSI – approved open source license, when forming the OSPO we listened to various concerns and feedback from MGB leadership and MGB innovators which lead to the creation of a MGB open science library of recommended licenses.  The MGB OSPO aims to support open science and other research and development projects that employ open source development practices through paradigms that are not truly open source such as open access, source available, and inner source.  Although the MGB open science license library will evolve and expand with emerging technologies, the MGB OSPO is committed to providing MGB innovators with a system compliant permissive open source license than is ai model and commercialization compatible, but also to supporting those developers who are utilizing limited elements of open – science to drive innovation.
